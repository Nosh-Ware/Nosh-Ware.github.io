            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Its a small editor used to modify the settings not normally editable directly in the original editor. I should be noted that these setting can be easily edited by open some of the files in you project with notepad (or whatever basic text editor your OS uses), this just serves to act as a slightly easier means to edit it.</p><br>

            <h2>So then why does it exist?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Basically, I wanted to stretch my legs in C#, and I decided to try and make something at least slightly useful to others.</p>
